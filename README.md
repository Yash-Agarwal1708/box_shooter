Box Shooter game made with unity  
It is a simple but fun first-person shooter game. The green boxes give you 5 points, the white boxes give you additional time and the yellow boxes reduce your time.   
I learned and implemented the instantiate function in unity to make the shooting mechanism. I also implemented a random enemy spawner, a countdown timer and a game manager.
